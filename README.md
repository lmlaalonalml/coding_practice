# Coding Practice Repository
Coding practice is based on various coding chalenges in edabit.com

This repository will store all output of my coding practice of various programming languages with challenges of vaiours difficulties.

## Commodore 64
BASIC V2, the Commodore 64 programming language is not supported in edabit.com, but the challenges are based on the various Python challenges.

Commodore 64 output programs are made in *GTK3VICE-3.8-win64* emulator, stored in virtual diskettes in *.d64 format.

The converted *.txt files are converted from *.prg using DirMaster to view code in a readable format.

## Python
Python output programs are made in *Spyder*, and IDE for Python
### NOTE: Note all coding in these output files are made by myself
